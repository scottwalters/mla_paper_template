Rather than filling this paper with automatically generated text, it would be better to use it as an MLA style guide, based on *The Purdue OWL*.^[OWL being an abbreviation for Online Writing Lab.]

# Problems with MLA in This Paper

## The Right Edge Isn't Ragged

Although I prefer this, some people may be frightened and alarmed.

## Paper and Section Titles are Large, Bold, and Sans Serif

It seems preferable to making everything homogeneous, but apparently the fine people at the MLA disagree.

# Technical Problems to be Addressed #

## The "Works Cited" Section is Absent from PDF Outlines

Why him do.

## Copies of the Repository Push to Remote by Default

This could cause problems if I forget myself, which isn't particularly far-fetched.  Adding a target for `new` to the Makefile, to remove all references to remote and blank this file, is probably the way to go.
