This repository aims to make it somewhat easier for me to write papers in MLA format, as is required by most humanities departments in the US.  Since I'm a reasonable person, I'd prefer doing this in plain text rather than using whatever shit Microsoft happens to be pushing.

# Usage

Reference materials go in `lib` with `references.bib`.

# TODO

- [ ] Setup citation management bindings.  This might end up requiring that I write an Emacs mode, which I will endeavor to view as a fun challenge rather than a massive, heinous waste of time.
